# Testing Forgot Password Functionality

## What I Fixed

The issue was that the password reset link was automatically signing you into the app instead of showing the password reset form. I've updated the reset password page to:

1. **Properly validate the reset session** - Check if the user has a valid password reset session
2. **Show appropriate loading states** - Display a loading spinner while validating
3. **Handle invalid/expired links** - Show error messages for invalid reset links
4. **Force logout after password change** - Sign out the user after successful password update to ensure they must log in with the new password
5. **Better error handling** - Improved error messages and user feedback

## How to Test

### Prerequisites

- Make sure your Supabase project is set up correctly
- Ensure you have the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` environment variables set

### Testing Steps

1. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to the login page:**

   - Go to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Click on "Log in" or navigate to the login form

3. **Request password reset:**

   - Click "Forgot password?" link
   - Enter a valid email address (must be an email that exists in your Supabase auth users)
   - Click "Send Reset Link"
   - You should see a success message

4. **Check your email:**

   - Look for the password reset email from Supabase
   - Click the reset link in the email

5. **Test the reset page:**

   - The link should now take you to a proper password reset form
   - You should see "Set a New Password" heading
   - Enter a new password (minimum 6 characters)
   - Confirm the password
   - Click "Update Password"

6. **Verify the flow:**
   - You should see a success message
   - The page should redirect to the home page after 2 seconds
   - You should be logged out automatically
   - Try logging in with your new password

### Expected Behavior

✅ **Before the fix:** Clicking the reset link would automatically log you into the app

✅ **After the fix:** Clicking the reset link shows a password reset form where you can set a new password

### Error Scenarios to Test

1. **Invalid/expired reset link:**

   - Try using an old reset link
   - Should show "Invalid Reset Link" error page

2. **Password validation:**

   - Try passwords less than 6 characters
   - Try mismatched password confirmation
   - Should show appropriate error messages

3. **Network errors:**
   - Test with network disconnected
   - Should show friendly error messages

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check browser console** for any JavaScript errors
2. **Verify Supabase configuration** in the dashboard
3. **Check email settings** in Supabase Auth settings
4. **Ensure the redirect URL** `http://localhost:3000/auth/reset-password` is added to your Supabase project's redirect URLs

### Dark Mode Support

The password reset functionality now fully supports dark mode:

- Forgot password dialog adapts to dark/light themes
- Reset password page has proper dark mode styling
- All form elements and messages support both themes

## Summary

The forgot password functionality should now work properly:

1. User clicks "Forgot password?" → Opens dialog
2. User enters email → Receives reset email
3. User clicks reset link → Goes to password reset form (not auto-login)
4. User sets new password → Gets logged out and redirected to home
5. User can now log in with new password
